# Dice Challenge Game

In this simple website, we created a simple Dice Challenge Game using tools like JavaScript for functionality and HTMl for laoyut and CSS for styling. For this project it displays two dices with each showing a number ranging from 1-6 and displays the winner who has the highest dice number. 

# JavaScript functions Used
  To generate a random number from 1-6, we used a function called;

      - Math.random();
  After creating a random number it displays the number in decimal format. To keep the numbers in whole notation we used here another function;

     - Math.floor();
  To select the text to change or to select an image to insert using JavaScript we used here a query called;

      - document.querySelectorAll();
      - document.querySelector().innerHTML();

  # Usage of If_Else Statement
  In JavaScript, an if...else statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It allows you to test if a condition is true or false, and then execute the corresponding block of code accordingly.

  In our project, the primary purpose of including If_Else Statement is to set conditions between two dices. If dice 1 number generates high number than dice 2, then player 1 wins and vice versa.
